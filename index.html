    <h1>Eagle</h1>
    <p>
      Eagle is the common name for many large birds of prey of the family
      Accipitridae. Eagles belong to several groups of genera, some of which are
      closely related. Most of the 60 species of eagle are from Eurasia and
      Africa.<sup>[1]</sup> Outside this area, just 14 species can be found—2 in
      North America, 9 in Central and South America, and 3 in Australia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eagles are not a natural group but denote essentially any[citation needed]
      bird of prey large enough to hunt sizeable (about 50 cm long or more
      overall) vertebrate prey.

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Eagles are large, powerfully built birds of prey, with heavy heads and
          beaks. Even the smallest eagles, such as the booted eagle (Aquila
          pennata), which is comparable in size to a common buzzard (Buteo buteo) or
          red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis), have relatively longer and more evenly
          broad wings, and more direct, faster flight – despite the reduced size of
          aerodynamic feathers. Most eagles are larger than any other raptors apart
          from some vultures. The smallest species of eagle is the South Nicobar
          serpent eagle (Spilornis klossi), at 450 g (1 lb) and 40 cm (16 in). The
          largest species are discussed below. Like all birds of prey, eagles have
          very large hooked beaks for ripping flesh from their prey, strong,
          muscular legs, and powerful talons. The beak is typically heavier than
          that of most other birds of prey. Eagles' eyes are extremely powerful. It
          is estimated that the martial eagle, whose eyes are more than two times
          larger than the human eye, has a visual acuity up to 8 times that of
          humans. This acuity enables eagles to spot potential prey from a very long
          distance.<sup>[2]</sup> This keen eyesight is primarily attributed to their extremely
          large pupils which ensure minimal diffraction (scattering) of the incoming
          light. The female of all known species of eagles is larger than the
          male.<sup>[3][4]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          Eagles normally build their nests, called eyries, in tall trees or on high
          cliffs. Many species lay two eggs, but the older, larger chick frequently
          kills its younger sibling once it has hatched. The parents take no action
          to stop the killing.<sup>[5][6]</sup> The dominant chick tends to be a female, as
          they are bigger than the male. It is said that eagles fly above clouds but
          this is not true. Eagles fly during storms and glide from the winds
          pressure. This saves the bird's energy. Due to the size and power of many
          eagle species, they are ranked at the top of the food chain as apex
          predators in the avian world. The type of prey varies by genus. The
          Haliaeetus and Ichthyophaga eagles prefer to capture fish, though the
          species in the former often capture various animals, especially other
          water birds, and are powerful kleptoparasites of other birds. The snake
          and serpent eagles of the genera Circaetus, Terathopius, and Spilornis
          predominantly prey on the great diversity of snakes found in the tropics
          of Africa and Asia. The eagles of the genus Aquila are often the top birds
          of prey in open habitats, taking almost any medium-sized vertebrate they
          can catch. Where Aquila eagles are absent, other eagles, such as the
          buteonine black-chested buzzard-eagle of South America, may assume the
          position of top raptorial predator in open areas. Many other eagles,
          including the species-rich genus Spizaetus, live predominantly in
          woodlands and forests. These eagles often target various arboreal or
          ground-dwelling mammals and birds, which are often unsuspectingly ambushed
          in such dense, knotty environments. Hunting techniques differ among the
          species and genera, with some individual eagles having engaged in quite
          varied techniques based on their environment and prey at any given time.
          Most eagles grab prey without landing and take flight with it, so the prey
          can be carried to a perch and torn apart.<sup>[7]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          The bald eagle is noted for having flown with the heaviest load verified
          to be carried by any flying bird, since one eagle flew with a 6.8 kg (15
          lb) mule deer fawn.<sup>[8]</sup> However, a few eagles may target prey considerably
          heavier than themselves; such prey is too heavy to fly with, thus it is
          either eaten at the site of the kill or taken in pieces back to a perch or
          nest. Golden and crowned eagles have killed ungulates weighing up to 30 kg
          (66 lb) and a martial eagle even killed a 37 kg (82 lb) duiker, 7–8 times
          heavier than the preying eagle.<sup>[7][9]</sup> Authors on birds David Allen Sibley,
          Pete Dunne, and Clay Sutton described the behavioral difference between
          hunting eagles and other birds of prey thus (in this case the bald and
          golden eagles as compared to other North American raptors):<sup>[10]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          They have at least one singular characteristic. It has been observed that
          most birds of prey look back over their shoulders before striking prey (or
          shortly thereafter); predation is after all a two-edged sword. All hawks
          seem to have this habit, from the smallest kestrel to the largest
          Ferruginous – but not the Eagles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the eagles are some of the largest birds of prey: only the condors
          and some of the Old World vultures are markedly larger. It is regularly
          debated which should be considered the largest species of eagle. They
          could be measured variously in total length, body mass, or wingspan.
          Different lifestyle needs among various eagles result in variable
          measurements from species to species. For example, many forest-dwelling
          eagles, including the very large harpy eagle, have relatively short
          wingspans, a feature necessary for being able to maneuver in quick, short
          bursts through densely forested habitats.<sup>[7]</sup> Eagles in the genus Aquila,
          found almost exclusively in open country, are noted for their ability to
          soar, and have relatively long wings for their size.<sup>[7]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          These lists of the top five eagles are based on weight, length, and
          wingspan, respectively. Unless otherwise noted by reference, the figures
          listed are the median reported for each measurement in the guide Raptors
          of the World<sup>[11]</sup> in which only measurements that could be personally
          verified by the authors were listed.<sup>[7]</sup>
